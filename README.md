Once registered, users can log-in.  For our purposes, users start with a balance of $1,000.

If users try to view past transactions without having made any yet, a message is displayed.

If users choose to request money, they are given a list of usernames they can request money from.

To request money, users must enter both a username to request money from, and the amount that they are requesting.

When requesting money, the other user must apprive the request before the transaction is processed.
Users may also send money to another user.  Unlike requests, sending money is automatically approved and the transaction is processed.
